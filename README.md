# About this App "Baking"
 If you love cooking, this App is for you. You will find several interesting recipes. You can select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

## As a developer, what I used to build this project:
- Featch data from the API by integrating the third-party library "Retrofit"
- Use Exoplayer to display videos
- Use RecyclerView to display the list items
- Add a home screen widget to to provide a complete user experience (ingredients list of the most recently consulted recipe will be updated timely on the home screen)
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets
- Makes use of Espresso to test aspects of the UI by registering the "idling resources" for an asynchronous operation

## Overview
